        Tracy Chou is a software engineer and advocate for diversity in technology related fields.
        She is best known for raising the profile of the low representation of women in technology companies.
        Chou identified possible reasons for the disparity in the representation of women in technology.
        She argued that if nobody suggests to a woman that a career in technology is possible then she is less likely to consider it.
        She also thinks that networking opportunities and role models are more limited for women and minorities.
        She also commented that women who looked very feminine were often ignored in technical settings.
